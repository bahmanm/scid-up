# ScidUp

Cross-Platform Chess Database and Analysis GUI. A fork of [the magnificent Scid project](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scid/).

⚠️⚠️⚠️ _It is in the pre-release stage._

## Aspirations

-  Be Lean: Drop features and code paths that are not used or are obsolete.
-  Modernise the codebase: Tests everywhere. Tcl/Tk 9. Re-organise the Tcl code.
-  Improve Installation and Packaging.
-  Enhance the feature-set with a special focus on ScidUp's inherited strengths:
   -  The fantastic database format.
   -  Analysis capability
   -  Engine management
 
## Non-Goals

-  Backward compatibility with Scid 5.x series.
